# ZacAi-3.0.0
Modular ZacAi first version but named v3.0.0 as its the 3rd version of Zac Ai just the first time we've broken down all the code into modules and a more developer friendly modular structure!

/lib
  /ai-engine/
    orchestrator.ts   // Main orchestrator (see above)
    engine.ts         // Core AI/LLM model logic
    detectors.ts      // Domain detection and task decomposition
    aggregator.ts     // Aggregates sub-task results
  /coding/
    engine.ts         // Coding domain expert engine
  /mathematics/
    engine.ts         // Mathematics domain expert engine
  /vocabulary/
    engine.ts         // Vocabulary domain expert engine
  /grammar/
    engine.ts         // Grammar domain expert engine
  /user/
    engine.ts         // User profile/preferences engine
  /system/
    engine.ts         // System status/health engine
  /shared/
    plugin-manager.ts // Global plugin/hook system
    semantic-search.ts// Semantic retrieval for all domains

## 1. **Restructure for Clarity and Modern Standards**

### **A. Folder Flattening & Clear Domain Grouping**
- **All business logic, agents, orchestration, and tools should ultimately live in `/lib`**—with subfolders by function/domain. 
- **Frontend code stays in `/app` and `/components`**; API in `/app/api/`.
- **Delete, move, or archive legacy, duplicate, and “original” files:**
  - Move legacy/original files into `/lib/legacy/`, or just delete if unneeded.
- **Move all “seed-populator”, “seed-structure”, and base JSON to `/seed/` or `/data/seed/`.**

**Recommend you have:**
```
/lib/
  ai-engine/
    orchestrator.ts
    memory.ts
    engine.ts
    detectors.ts
    feedback.ts
    multimodal.ts
    suggestion-engine.ts
    explainability.ts
    rate-limiter.ts
    safety.ts
    /agents/
      agent-registry.ts
      init.ts
      planner-agent/
      executor-agent/
    /system-prompts/
      coding.txt ...
  coding/
    engine.ts
    /tools/
      code-executor.ts
      linter.ts
      refactorer.ts
  mathematics/
    engine.ts
    /tools/
  ...
  infrastructure/
    cache.ts
    logger.ts
    queue-manager.ts
    embedding-service.ts
  knowledge/
    retriever.ts
    /sources/
      github.ts
      ...
  workers/
    process-prompt-worker.ts
    server-init.ts
/components/
  code-editor/
    ...(editor, output...) 
/app/
  ...(Next.js routes)...
/data/
  /feedback/
  /memory/
  /learnt/
  /knowledge/
  /queue/
  /system/
      app.log ...
  /seed/
    (all seed/populator scripts, base data)
```

### **B. Remove/Ban Redundant/Confusing Subfolders**
- **Dissolve or merge**: `/core/`, `/context/`, `/reasoning/`, `/integration/`, `/sequencing/`, `/storage/`, `/system/`, `/user/`.
  - Migrate critical files into `/lib/ai-engine/`, `/lib/infrastructure/`, or dedicated domain folders.
- Remove `/engines/` if `/lib/ai-engine/` is your primary orchestrator home.
- **API endpoints**: Consolidate under `/app/api/` only.

### **C. Consistency and Standards**
- **All TypeScript:** Ensure all `*.js` core/engine files are now `*.ts` with real typings.
- **Colocate types:** Use `/types/` for global, but keep domain-specific types near their modules.

## 2. **Addressing Missing/Misaligned Elements**

- **Are all agents present?** Minimum: `agent-registry.ts`, `planner-agent/`, `executor-agent/`, and an extensible loader.
- **Engines:** Each domain (`coding/`, `mathematics/`, `vocabulary/`, etc.) should have its own `engine.ts` and `/tools/` folder.
- **Worker processes:** Confirm `/lib/workers/` has at least a prompt worker and a code-executor worker if code execution is async.
- **Logging:** Use `/lib/infrastructure/logger.ts` instead of ad-hoc `console.log`.
- **Knowledge/RAG:** `/lib/knowledge/retriever.ts` and at least one `/knowledge/sources/` module.
- **Tests:** Add `/tests/` or colocated `.test.ts` files for major systems.

## 3. **For Codespaces and Reliable Local Dev**

- **`.devcontainer/` directory:**  
  Add `devcontainer.json` that specifies Node version, forwarding port 3000 (Next.js), and install scripts for any native LLM/tool deps.

  **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Next.js AI Codespace",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:20",
    "forwardPorts": [3000],
    "postCreateCommand": "npm install",
    "features": {
      "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1": {
        "version": "20"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **Startup commands:**
  In the Codespaces terminal, use:
  ```
  npm install
  npm run dev         # Start Next.js/app
  npm run worker      # (If you have a script for async worker)
  ```
  Make sure these are in your `package.json` scripts.

- **Ensure**:  
  - All source files are committed.
  - All dependencies are in `package.json`.
  - Model weights (if used) are in `/public/models/` or a defined path, and not .gitignored accidentally.
  - You have a root-level `README.md` that gives **clear setup and run instructions**.

## 4. **What Will Take You Next-Level and Industry-Ready**
- **Multi-modal orchestration** (text, image, code).
- **Multi-agent, multi-domain architecture**: Each domain, agent, and tool is plug-and-play.
- **Streaming and async—frontend and backend.**
- **Full test and monitoring setup (Jest, Playwright, or similar + health diagnostics).**
- **RAG/embeddings:** Automated doc/KB ingestion and semantic search.
- **Clear, commented, and typesafe API—no dark corners or mysterious files.**
- **Modern devops/container infra (Codespaces, Docker, GitHub Actions for CI/CD).**

## 5. **Summary: Action Items**

- **Reorganize project:**  
  Flatten, move logic to `/lib/`, UI to `/components/`, data to `/data/seed/`, `/data/system/`, etc.
- **Update imports:**  
  Once restructured, do a global search-replace for old path imports.
- **Add `.devcontainer/` and scripts for smooth Codespaces use.**  
- **Review for missing files:**  
  Each main agent/engine, per above, should have a matching file. Add basic stubs if missing.
- **Cleanup and update all documentation and scripts.**

**If you want, I can give you a ready-to-run `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or a more explicit migration step list! Let me know your pain point and I’ll give concrete next steps.**

You are on the cusp of a truly world-class code LLM/AI project. A single commit that reorganizes and modernizes your structure could multiply your velocity and maintainability.
