 * Role: Code Moderation & Compliance Module
 * Description:
 *   - Checks code for unsafe, insecure, or non-compliant patterns.
 *   - Ensures outputs are safe and production-ready.
 * Advanced Features:
 *   - Integrates with security scanner and explainability tools.
 *   - Can be extended for real-time monitoring and alerts.
 * Future Enhancements:
 *   - Add AI-powered code bias and compliance detection.
